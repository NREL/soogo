    """Target value acquisition function for the RBF model based on [#]_, [#]_,
    and [#]_.

    Every iteration of the algorithm sequentially chooses a number from 0 to
    :attr:`cycleLength` + 1 (inclusive) and runs one of the procedures:

    * Inf-step (0): Selects a sample point that minimizes the
      :math:`\\mu` measure, i.e., :meth:`mu_measure()`. The point selected is
      the farthest from the current sample using the kernel measure.

    * Global search (1 to :attr:`cycleLength`): Minimizes the product of
      :math:`\\mu` measure by the distance to a target value. The target value
      is based on the distance to the current minimum of the surrogate. The
      described measure is known as the 'bumpiness measure'.

    * Local search (:attr:`cycleLength` + 1): Minimizes the bumpiness measure with
      a target value equal to the current minimum of the surrogate. If the
      current minimum is already represented by the training points of the
      surrogate, do a global search with a target value slightly smaller than
      the current minimum.

    After each sample point is chosen we verify how close it is from the current
    sample. If it is too close, we replace it by a random point in the domain
    drawn from an uniform distribution. This is strategy was proposed in [#]_.

    :param cycleLength: Length of the global search cycle. Stored in
        :attr:`cycleLength`.

    .. attribute:: cycleLength

        Length of the global search cycle to be used in :meth:`optimize()`.

    .. attribute:: _cycle

        Internal counter of cycles. The value to be used in the next call of
        :meth:`optimize()`.

        The bumpiness measure :math:`g_y` was first defined by Gutmann (2001)
        with
        suggestions of usage for global optimization with RBF functions. Gutmann
        notes that :math:`g_y(x)` tends to infinity
        when :math:`x` tends to a training point of the surrogate, and so they
        use :math:`-1/g_y(x)` for the minimization problem. Björkman and
        Holmström use :math:`-\log(1/g_y(x))`, which is the same as minimizing
        :math:`\log(g_y(x))`, to avoid a flat minimum. This option seems to
        slow down convergence rates for :math:`g_y(x)` in `[0,1]` since it
        increases distances in that range.

        The present implementation uses genetic algorithms by default, so there
        is no point in trying to make :math:`g_y` smoother.

    This implementation is based on the one of MISO-MS used in the paper [#]_.
    The original method, Multi-level Single-Linkage, was described in [#]_.
    In each iteration, the algorithm generates a pool of candidates and select
    the best candidates (lowest predicted value) that are far enough from each
    other. The number of candidates chosen as well as the distance threshold
    vary with each iteration. The hypothesis is that the successful candidates
    each belong to a different region in the space, which may contain a local
    minimum, and those regions cover the whole search space. In the sequence,
    the algorithm runs multiple local minimization procedures using the
    successful candidates as local guesses. The results of the minimization are
    collected for the new sample.

class TransitionSearch(AcquisitionFunction):
    """
    Transition search acquisition function as described in [#]_.

    This acquisition function is used to find new sample points by perturbing
    the current best sample point and uniformly selecting points from the
    domain. The scoreWeight parameter can be used to control the transition
    from local to global search. A scoreWeight close to 1.0 will favor
    the predicted function value (local search), while a scoreWeight close to
    0.0 will favor the distance to previously sampled points (global search).

    The evaluability of candidate points is predicted using the candidate
    surrogate model. If the evaluability probaility of a candidate point
    is below a threshold, the point is discarded. If no candidate points
    remain after this filtering, all candidate points are considered
    evaluable.

    The candidate points are scored using a weighted value of their predicted
    function value and the distance to previously sampled points. The candidate
    with the best total score is selected as the new sample point.
